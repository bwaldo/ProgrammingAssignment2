## The below functions will be used to cache the inverse of a matrix using R scoping rules.

## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.

## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above. 
## If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed),

## Computing the inverse of a square matrix can be done with the solve function in R. 
## For example, if X is a square invertible matrix, then solve(X) returns its inverse.
